Live application will be published as soon as it's ready. Target for version 1.0 is to be done by 15th of November 2019.

### Objective of the project

This project's objective is to demonstrate "a professional-like process" of creating a small-to-mid sized web app and taking it to production. Every step of the project is done solely by me [Ville Rahkonen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ville-rahkonen-685117137/). The final product will also work as my personal website for the future, where I can showcase all my projects.
